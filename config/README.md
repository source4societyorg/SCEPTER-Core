# Configuration

Scepter configuration files are centralized here. There are three kinds:

credentials.json
parameters.json
services.json

#credentials.json

This file is autogenerated by the `node bin/scepter project:initialize` command. This is not checked into the repository due to security concerns. It creates a structure similar to the following:

    {
      environments: {
        yourenv: {
          provider: {
            aws: {
              "accessKeyId":"",
              "secretAccessKey":"",
              "region":"",
              "account":"",
              "maxRetries":""
            },
            azure: {
              "subscriptionId": "",
              "appId": "",
              "displayName": "",
              "tenantId": "",
              "clientId": "",
              "password": ""
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

# parameters.json

This file is also generated by `node bin/scepter project:initialize` and contains application specific configuration such as the application name, the shell being used. 

    {
      "appName": "scepter",
      "shell": "bash"
    } 

# services.json

This one must be manually generated, contains a list of services and specific configuration such as that which may override the global application configuration, and security information. This should be checked into the repository

    {
      "environments": {
          "dev": {
              "provider": "aws:lambda",
              "configuration": {
                  "SERVICE": {
                      "serviceName": "TestService",
                      "function": "testServiceFunction",
                      "security": ["ROLE_ANONYMOUS"]
                  }
              }
          }
      }
    }
